							<p><strong>Paypal Integration</strong></p>

<p>To contact a new customer simply head to the “Manage Orders” tab - then click “View order” - And finally click on the “Contact customer” button.</p>
<p>Alternatively if an order has already been marked as completed  head to the “Order History” tab and follow the same process.</p>

<p>When a new message has been received by a customer or a member of the Prazar team you will see a red dot appear above the “Messages” tab.</p>

</p>
<p>Promo codes can be turned on or off or edited at any time by using the manage promo codes section at the bottom of the “Manage profile/shop” tab.</p>

<p><strong>Express Shipping Explained</strong></p>
<p>It is entirely up to you the seller as to whether or not you offer express shipping on orders.
</p>

</p>
<p><strong>Free shipping threshold explained</strong></p>
<p>From the “Mange profiel/shop” tab you can define the free shipping threshold for your entire store.
</p>

</p>
<p>The free shipping threshold if activated will be shown on each individual product page under the “Delivery & Returns tab”.</p>
<p>Please make sure all orders go out with a printed invoice inside parcels and that tracking numbers and the name of the shipping company or link to their website are uploaded via the “Order Status” button as soon as they are available.
</p>

</p>

<p><strong>Product Returns-  Customer change of mind</strong></p>
<p>While it’s rare that customers return products it is Prazar policy that all customers have up to 30 days from receipt of item(s) to make returns. You will receive email confirmation of any requested returns, please then head to the “Order History” tab and click on “View Order”.There will also be a red dot located on the tab and view order button which indicates that action is required.

<p>If you click the accept refund button, please then provide the customer with information for the next steps. For example if you wish the item to be returned then please provide the correct returns address and any other information they may require. 
</p>

<p>Personalised items, underwear, food & beverages, earrings, made to order items, or open bathroom or beauty products are non-refundable. All goods must also be returned by the original Customer.
</p>
<p>It is also against Prazar policy for customers to exchange items.</p>
<p>You can view our full returns policy by heading to our website and clicking on the ‘Terms and Conditions” page (Clause 1.5)
</p>
<p>Customers can opt for a refund as soon as vendors mark orders as “Complete” and will have 30 days from receipt of goods to do so.</p>

<p><strong>Product Returns -  Faulty or Damaged  Products</strong></p>
<p>For any return of faulty products this will also show as a “Return Requested” under the “Order history” tab.
The customer should have already defined in the comments whether or not they require a refund or a new item to be sent out. 
</p>
<p>If they have requested a refund please proceed and process the full refund, the customer will then be refunded the full amount including any shipping charges they incurred upon delivery of items. 
</p>
<p>If the customer has requested a replacement item to be sent out please make sure to confirm this in the “next steps for customer” text box. You can then press the “cancel” button to cancel the payment refund. 
If you require the faulty item to be sent back then please make sure you send out a prepaid package, provide the customer with prepaid labels or reimburse them for any delivery charges.
</p>
<p>You can contact customers at any time via the Prazar chat tool, and by clicking the “contact customer” button when viewing an order. 
</p>
<p>It is against Prazar policy for customers to exchange items. 
</p>
<p>You can view our full returns policy by heading to our  ‘Terms and Conditions” page 
Customers can opt for a refund as soon as vendors mark orders as “Complete” and will have 30 days from receipt of goods to do so.
</p>
<p><strong>Cancelling orders</strong></p>
<p>If you are unable to fulfill an order please head to the “Manage Orders” tab, click view order and then cancel order. The customer will then be automatically refunded. 
</p>
<p>Please also make sure you message the customer by using the “contact customer” button to explain why the order was cancelled. 
</p>
<p><strong>Manage products</strong></p>
<p>From the “Manage products” tab on your seller dashboard you will be able to add new products and edit existing inventory.</p>
<p>Whether you need to add more photos, change your product categories or simply update the availability of stock you’ll be able to do it all here. 
</p>
<p><strong>Product Images</strong></p>
<p>One of the most crucial aspects to a product listing.</p>
<p>We cannot stress enough how important it is to have good quality photos for your product listing.</p>
<p>Please use high resolution images and make sure that the first photo which will appear as the hero image is taken on a pure white background.</p>
<p>Images must fit within the below dimensions 
</p>
<p>Width 400 min X 1000 max PX  and height 400 min X 1000 max PX
</p>
<p>Prazar monitors all image uploads, and if we feel that certain photos are not up to our standards we will get in touch.</p>
<p><strong>Product Descriptions</strong></p>
<p>Another key element to any product listing, and where you really get to showcase your unique products. 
</p>
<p>In our experience listings with just a few words under the product description sell far less than those with well thought out text.
</p>
<p>We suggest using somewhere between 150 to 200 words of descriptive text per product.
</p>
<p>Please do not put any links to your website or contact details in product descriptions as it is against Prazar policy.</p>

<p><strong>Product Variants</strong></p>
<p>We recognise that many of our vendors products are not only unique but can be personalised in more than one way, and that’s why we allow every seller to add custom product variants to their listings. </p><p>
To add custom variants to a product please click the variation option and then variants when uploading a new product, this will then take you to the full variants page.</p><p>
Alternatively if you want to add or edit variants to existing inventory click on the “Mange products” tab, edit products and finally the edit or add variant button for the corresponding product. </p><p>
If you can’t find what you’re looking for in the pre selected drop down menu of variants then just click any of the 5 custom variant slots and enter your unique information. 
</p>

<p><strong>Custom labels</strong></p>
<p>If your product has an option for custom writing or labels this can be added by clicking yes on the customisation option when uploading or editing a product. From here you can input a maximum of 5 labels and 50 characters per label. Once saved the customer will then have the option to input custom text into a box or boxes on the product listings page. You will also be able to define the price paid by the customer for custom text, however this will still show as an added option on the product listing.</p><p> 
This feature is ideal if you have products which can have custom text added to them. 
</p>


<p><strong>Transaction History tab</strong></p><p>
From this tab you can view all successful transactions from fulfilled orders. The amount shown is the money received from each order minus the Prazar commission.</p> 

<p><strong>Order History tab</strong></p><p>
Once orders have been marked as complete by vendors they will automatically move from the “Manage Orders” tab to the “Order History” tab. If a refund or return request has been initiated by a customer you will see a red dot above the “Order history” tab.Once you have clicked through you will also see a red dot on the “view order” button for any orders which require action to be taken.</p><p>
<p>You can also contact customers and download invoices from this section. </p>

<p><strong>Commission and payments Explained</strong></p><p>
As a platform Prazar was built to be completely transparent with its vendors and customers, and therefore we don’t believe in upfront or hidden charges. </p><p>
To make sure the site runs as smoothly as possible and to help with any issues that may arise vendor or customer side we have a  whole team of people working behind the scenes day and night.</p><p>
We also have a clear and thought out advertising strategy to make sure we attract the right traffic to the site and get maximum coverage for our sellers.</p><p>
Every time you make a sale on Prazar we take a 17% commission and no other fees or charges. </p><p> 
<p> This means you can list as many products as you like and not have to worry about being charged if you don’t make a sale. Vendors are even paid into their PayPal accounts as soon as orders are marked as “Complete”.</p>
