Looking forward for your response.

Warm regards,

Dear Tong,

I found your job listing for IOS Developer on Upwork, and I’d love to work on the
iPhone Guitar App(need someone who has the guitar sound library).
I have experience doing SWIFT, Objective- C, Ionic, React Native and developed over 50+ Apps. 
Please find attachment of my Resume to review my portfolio. 

Over last 4+ years, I've build many interactive apps having varied functionalities and complexities including hardware integration (Health-care, Restaurant, Retail), social media integration, cloud data storage, payments, beacons, backend analytics, location tracking, push notifications, messaging and communication.

This project is particularly important to me because I like the tagline "Reinventing touch".
I would love to get started on your project.

Cheers,

Naveen
-----------------------------------

My name is Atit. I refer tot he post and would like to share that I have sound knowledge of HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript Experience creating HTML pages independently and decide front end architecture. I am well versed with CSS positioning, experience on Twitter Bootstrap. 


I would love the opportunity to talk with you about the position and what I might bring to it.


I've attached my resume and clips, and will email later this week to see if we can arrange a time to talk. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best,
----------------------------------------
Hi Shaun,

Just to follow up with you - Did you get a chance to look at my last message? Let me know if we can discuss the Mobile App project.

Cheers,
Anna
-----------------------------------------
Hi [NAME],
My name is [NAME], and I build WordPress websites.
I’ve been going to your first location of Cupcakes Forever [INSERT BUSINESS] for
years, and I LOVE your pumpkin spice cupcakes. I noticed you’re opening a second
location (so exciting!).
If you need any help revamping your website or brand while you expand your
business, I’d love to help. I can build you a WordPress site that makes it possible for
customers to order online and find out about your two locations on their mobile
devices. You can even update the site on your own, and use a blog page to share
your story with customers.
I’m sure I’ll see you soon (I have a cupcake habit), and I’d love to talk to you about
your site. Here’s a site I built for [INSERT BUSINESS HERE] recently: [LINK].
Cheers,

-----------------------------------------
We are looking to partner with a developer or team who's core competency is Ionic cross platform development leveraging the latest trends and best practices to achieve near native quality development for our project.
We are developing a cross platform mobile app that essentially works as an Uber for lawn mowing services.
Backend API is built using Ruby on Rails and you will be working directly with product manager and Rails developer to coordinate and complete tasks involved in each sprint. Availability and prompt communication are a must.
The budget for this project is $24,000 over 12 separate sprints.
Please examine this prototype to look over the screens and functionality 
https://invis.io/AM75UZVRX#/68711580_Login
Then study this roadmap laying out the first 7 sprints.
https://trello.com/b/oD7YGOzV/vendor-mobile-app-roadmoap
The budget for each sprint is $2,000 with each one to be completed in less that 6 weeks. 
In total there will be 12 sprints to complete the project for a total of $24,000 paid $2,000 per completed sprint deployed and QA'd first in TestFlight and Android apk, then both the App store and Play store. We will test on multiple devices for both Android and iOS before approving tasks and expect thorough testing on your part as well.
Much time and money has been invested in the visual design and UX and as such we will only accept pixel perfect execution of the PSD's.
With that being said, the winning contractor will need to have exceptional technical skills, moreover will also need to be very concerned with UX and UI. Some requests to API can be very large so experience working with backend developer to build efficient API calls is very important.
Functionally, the app must load smooth with loading animators between all major actions and smooth transitions between views.
Currently our app is only web based, we have over over 5,000 active users for the web and web mobile app.
The API will only return content which is either new or changed since last fetch. Saving data locally: Data is saved to localStorage, and loaded from localStorage on app startup.
Experience with larger datasets is necessary. For example, pagination by scrolling will be used for large lists of items. Familiarity with Google Maps API  and Stripe payment gateway is required.
Please do not apply unless you can provide solid examples of YOUR previous Ionic work that we can look at in the Apple App store
To show you have read through all of this, place "Hi there GreenPal" when you apply

Dear John, Susie, and Rob:
I hope you’re well. I’m having a pinch point in my client pipeline and I’m looking for some feedback—and I think you’re the perfect person to help me out because I’m pretty sure you’re a pro at dealing with this type of client request in your business.
This email will probably take you about 10-15 minutes to read and respond,and I’d be incredibly grateful for your straight-up advice. I’m predicting that you know exactly how to deal with this problem, which is why I’m contacting each of you.
If any of you are swamped today or in the middle of something that needs your attention, feel free to delete this email or send a quick “so sorry, can’t,” so I know not to bother you again. Ideally, you’ll know a great resource (a book or link) that answers this problem and can think through this quickly with me. Many thanks for your brilliance in advance.
Here’s the situation: … I’d like to come up with a great response that changes the answer I’m getting (below) into an answer that converts into a sale. This email chain below is a typical one for me … (and here you continue to describe the email you get and copy, exactly, the messages you get and the emails you’ve sent previously.)
_____________________________________________________
There are two great ways to respond to nonspecific requests for your time:

Question 1: “Can I ask you a quick question over lunch and pick your brain?”
Answer: “If it’s a quick question, send it my way right now and I’ll answer it quickly! If it’s a longer conversation you want to have, my lunch hours are reserved for clients right now, so you can book time with me here [insert link to your consulting page].” (Hat tip to Marie Forleo and Laura Roeder for this gem.)

Question 2: The vague “I need help and I’d love your advice … ” that generally ends with an ellipses “…”
Answer: “Hey—Thanks for your email. The more specific you can be in your question, the easier it will be for me to help you. Would you put together a list of specific questions you’d like to have answered and I’ll see if I can pull together a quick set of resources and links or point you to the right place?”

I would like to buy 50 interpretability machine learning ( deep learning ) models. 

Each model has to be different, different and new approach, not a copy of other techniques. 

Dataset/input: something simple, your devs can choose it. Atari games from openAI might be good.

Can you help?
---------
Just to make sure, we can't use those: 
https://github.com/kundajelab/deeplift


Lime: https://www.r-bloggers.com/explaining-complex-machine-learning-models-with-lime/amp/

---------
http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/07/how-ai-detectives-are-cracking-open-black-box-deep-learning
--------------------
Can he create interpretability models? 
I really don't care whether he knows all of those things above or not.

I want to buy Interpretability models for deep learning techniques such as deep reinforcement learning, restricted Boltzmann machine etc.
--------------------------
Could you please ask him first?

Because our last call wasn't successful so it would be good to let him know about those specific techniques and our need before the call.
----------------------
Yes but I just gave you those specific techniques. Also, this might be a good inspiration for him https://www.h2o.ai/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/MLI.pdf
--------------------
Thank you. As for the call - I'm ready when you are. The only thing I'm asking for is to optimize our time because during our previous call your devs were basically asking me what is explainable AI / interpretability in ML etc. 

Thanks a lot.
